# Examples of simple RISC-V bare-metal programs

The bootrom loads and executes boot.elf file from SD card DOS partition.
boot.elf is regular executable ELF, it can contain any software suitable for RISC-V M mode.

## "Hello World" program

Runs on any RISC-V 64-bit or 32-bit configuration.
Outputs "Hello World!" message using UART.

64-bit RISC-V:
```
cd bare-metal/hello-world
make clean all
```

32-bit RISC-V, use 32-bit compiler:
```
cd bare-metal/hello-world
make CROSS_COMPILE=../../workspace/gcc/riscv/bin/riscv32-unknown-elf- CFLAGS='-march=rv32imac -mabi=ilp32' clean all
```

Copy boot.elf to the SD card, insert the card into SD slot on the board, press reset button.

## Using debugger to download and run the program

boot.elf can be downloaded directly into RISC-V memory and started using Xilinx debugger - xsdb:

```
xsdb% connect
tcfchan#0
xsdb% targets -set -filter {name =~ "Hart #0*"}
xsdb% stop
xsdb% dow -clear boot.elf
